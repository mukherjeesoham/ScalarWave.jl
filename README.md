Solve the non-linear Einstein's field equations in spherical symmetry. This branch
inherits all the features introduced in Schwarzschild, for e.g.; the type system
and not in Vaidya, for e.g., symbolic differentiation [beta]. 

### This repository should
[] Solve a test coupled non-linear equation for consistency checks.
[] Solve the Einstein's field equations in spherical symmetry in double null coordinates. 
[] Support arbitrary types for computation
[] Implement symbolic differentiation to compute Ricci and Weyl tensors
[] Use futures to distribute the computation
[] Replace Master
